#Truth in the Age of the Internet

  We live in strange times. Fact and fiction blur when it comes to news. 140-character snippets of text conceived out of pure imagination can define a presidential election. 
Maybe you’ve felt it, you haven’t — but there is a war waging right now, between factions that absorb and perpetuate lies and conspiracies and ones that hold fast to the truth. 
At times (more than ever, this election cycle), it feels like the former is winning.

  Maybe that’s always been the case. But I’m inclined to think not, because the internet has changed incentives for the media, 
the people who put forth information about what’s happening in the world. In the past, with a finite number of news sources and new stories, fact-checking was important.
A reputable institution would publish a story backed by a team of people whose jobs it was to vet the facts it presented. 
They were motivated to do that well because their business model relied on trust, reputation — which takes time to build and is easily destroyed. On the flip side, 
new sources that published misinformation or flat-out lies could only get so far before they were debunked. 
The modern conception of virality just didn’t exist; information didn’t travel quickly enough.

  But now? Clicks dictate what lives and what dies. The measure of a successful story is what’s captured the most attention from the billions of eyeballs on the internet. 
And we find that individuals are ill-equipped to discern truth from lie. I’m a savvy internet user who consumes media heavily and questions anything that doesn’t feel right, 
and I still fall prey to hoaxes. Same for most people I know. Last week, people started protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. 
A Facebook status along these lines went viral:

  "The Morton County Sheriff’s Department has been using Facebook check-ins to find out who is at 
  Standing Rock in order to target them in attempts to disrupt the camps. So Water Protectors are calling on 
  EVERYONE to check-in at Standing Rock, ND, or the Standing Rock Indian Reservation to overwhelm and confuse them. 
  This is concrete action that can protect people putting their bodies and well-beings on the line that we can do 
  without leaving our homes. Will you join me in Standing Rock?"

  Millions of people checked into Standing Rock on Facebook. And yet--the status, well-intentioned as it was, 
made little sense in the first place. Why would the police be using Facebook check-ins to identify protesters? 
Presumably protesters were physically there and far easier to identify and disrupt in person.
Snopes debunked the status soon as it went viral--but few saw it, and by then it was too late. 
In the age of the internet, a few whispers between friends becomes a deafening shout. 

  Trust and reputation still matter for the legacy institutions...but with new upstarts and increasing noise,
they're more and more difficult to identify. More frighteningly, there's a groing contingent of people
who don't buy into trustworthy, reputable source simply because they're the establishment, part of 
(what is percieved as) carefully a woven web of conspiracy and intrique that crosses over politics and 
big business all the way to the media.

  The irony is that the vastnesss and ubiquity of modern data don't make the truth any more concrete. 
There are tens of thousands of emails from Hillary Clinton's servers publically available, and yet the majority 
of people calling for her arrest haven't read a single one. There are hundreds fo video clips and tweets 
recording Donald Trump's controversial, offensive, and often bizarre comments, and yet he's able to blatantly deny
them with virtually no repercussions from his supporters. Many moments this year, I've felt like we're living in 
an Orwellian dystopia, except history doesn't even need to be erased for doublethink to occur--people can see
hard facts, right beside their contradicting lies, and convince themselves of the latter.

  Is there anything that can be done? Companies like Google have doubled down on fact-checking, 
and people have called upon Facebook to work on stopping the spread of misinformation on its platform. 
Legislation could make it illegal to deliberately propagate false news, although that runs into scary 
territory for free speech and relies on a prohibitively high burden of proof to show intent. 
Sam Lessin offered another wild suggestion in his weekly column for The Information:
  
  "To deal with the race to the bottom of instant free communication, we might have to start making it 
  unprofitable for attention-driven, advertising-supported platforms to cover politics. 
  One idea would be to force news platforms to give back to the government a percentage of their revenue in 
  proportion to the amount of time they spend covering candidates — a coverage tax. 
  It wouldn’t be insane for CNN to give 50% of its revenue to the government because 50% of their 
  content is election coverage. That would basically say that you can’t profit off the public discourse at all. 
  We the people own it."

  At the very least, it’s worth considering what drastic changes need to be made, 
whether that’s by the government, social media platforms, news outlets, or just individual people — 
because the problem’s only getting worse. The startling reality that we’ve had to confront in 2016 is that 
the pure act of making a statement (any statement) and presenting it as fact cements it as 
truth for someone in the world. Farhad Manjoo, a New York Times reporter, recently published a piece
(which you should read) that closes with a quote from the managing editor of Snopes on the exhausting 
futility of what they do:
  
  "There’s always more work to be done. There’s always more. It’s Sisyphean — we’re all pushing that boulder up the hill,
  only to see it roll back down."
